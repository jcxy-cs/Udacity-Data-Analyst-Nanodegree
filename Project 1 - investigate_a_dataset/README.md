# Project 1 - Investigate a Dataset:

This project explores medical appointment no-shows, in an attempt to identify the variables that may help in predicting future no-shows. 

## Dateset
The project explores approximately 110,000 and its 14 associated variables, gathered from Brazil's Bolsa Fam√≠lia welfare program, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).

## Summary of findings 
The analysis found that the variables: age, neighbourhood, hypertension, handicap, diabetes, handicap, SMS received, and number of days wait may be more useful to in predicting patient no-shows. Other variables such as gender, alcoholism and the day of the medical appointment do not seem to be as important when trying to predict no-shows in the medical appointments
