# Project 2 - Analyse A/B Test Results

In this project, I performed A/B testing on the dataset of e-commerce website. The purpose of the A/B testing is to identify if the e-commerce website new landing page increases the conversion rate of customers. To do this, a null and alternative hypothesis was created and tested using random and the conversion rate of users under the null and alternative hypothesis was compared. A regression based approach was also conducted to confirm the findings.
