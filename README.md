# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree
I worked through the data analytics lifecycle with Python's data analysis libraries (Numpy, Pandas &amp; Matplotlib) and SQL. Wrangling, exploring, analysing and communicating data findings across four main projects. 

## Project 1 - Investigate a Dataset
This project explores medical appointment no-shows, in an attempt to identify the variables that may help in predicting future no-shows. The project explores approximately 110,000 and its 14 associated variables, gathered from Brazil's Bolsa Fam√≠lia welfare program, which can be found [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments). 

The analysis found that the variables: age, neighbourhood, hypertension, handicap, diabetes, handicap, SMS received, and number of days wait may be more useful to in predicting patient no-shows. Other variables such as gender, alcoholism and the day of the medical appointment do not seem to be as important when trying to predict no-shows in the medical appointments

## Project 2 - Analyse A/B Test Results
In this project, I performed A/B testing on the dataset of e-commerce website. The purpose of the A/B testing is to identify if the e-commerce website new landing page increases the conversion rate of customers. To do this, a null and alternative hypothesis was created and tested using random and the conversion rate of users under the null and alternative hypothesis was compared. A regression based approach was also conducted to confirm the findings.

## Project 3 - Wrangle and Analyse Data
In this project, we explored WeRateDog's twitter data. I gathered data from 3 different sources: a local file, a file, hosted by Udacity, downloaded programmatically via the Request library and data obtained by querying Twitters API to gather community interaction data. The data was then cleaned and joined into a single DataFrame to be explored, investigating the user engagement of different dog types featured on the WeRateDogs twitter

## Project 4 - Communicate Data Findings
In this project, I worked through the data analysis lifecycle, with specific focus on using the Matplotlib and Seaborn packages to aide in our exploration of the dataset. Going through a univariate, bivariate and multivariate exploration of the features found in this bike sharing dataset, this project explored the overall usage of the bike sharing program through the number of users and durations of rides
